# Voice Assistant with AI and Text-to-Speech

This project is a **Voice Assistant** web application that integrates **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** for generating AI-based responses and uses **Google Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for audio playback of the responses. It allows users to give voice commands and receive AI responses in both text and audio formats. The application also includes a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience.

---

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Record and send voice commands using the browser's SpeechRecognition API.
- **AI Integration**: Processes user input with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate intelligent responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI-generated responses into audio using Google TTS.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Communication is handled in real-time using Socket.io.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes.
- **Responsive Interface**: Clean and simple UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## Start the Server
Start the application server with the following command: 
```bash
node server.js

## Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```bash
http://localhost:3000


## Usage Instructions

- Use the Dark/Light Mode Toggle to switch themes.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SpeechRecognition API, SpeechSynthesis API
### Backend:
Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
### Third-Party Services:
OpenAI API, Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) API

## Known Issues
The application might not work on older browsers that do not support SpeechRecognition or SpeechSynthesis APIs.
Google TTS has a 200-character limit for each request, so long responses are split into chunks.
